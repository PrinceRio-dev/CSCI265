// Items consist of titles, description strings, and address strings
// identifying the (quaternary) addresses of the lower left and upper right
// corners the item occupies.
//
// For instance, we might use an item to describe a sales region for a representative
//     Item("Fred\'s territory", "Fred is in charge of sales here", "1013", "120")
//
// During Item creation, the addresses for the lower left and upper right corners
//    are padded to full addresses (extreme lower left, upper right) and the
//    quadrant containing the entire region is also calculated and stored
// (e.g., if our full addresses were 10 characters long, then for Fred's region
//  the padded addresses would be 1013000000 and 1200000000, and the enclosing
//  quadrant would be 1)
//
// Items are currently used only for data storage and retrieval, so the only associated
//    methods are the constructor, destructor, and lookup
