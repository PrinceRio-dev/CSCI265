CSCI 265 lab 1 marks/feedback:

Mark (out of 18): 18


Feedback:
=========

The "see also" section could reasonably refer the reader to the
project web page for a more detailed description of the items and
trees in use.

The Description section should probably include a very short summary
of the interactive commands (Q V etc).

Note that [FILENAME] isn't actually supported by the demo program.
