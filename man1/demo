.SH SYNOPSIS
demo.cpp 
.SH DESCRIPTION
We are using the demo program for storing the information of each items into the quadtrees.
Overall, in this program we are using three classes which are Item class, ItemTree class, and Address
class. There are different types of commands that user can use for running this demo program.
Here I am going to list all the commands and thier purpose:

      H - This command is for the help menu and it will list all the commnads
      Q - This command is for terminating the program (quit the program)
      V - This command is for switching from verbose to 
          quiet mode and quiet to verbose mode
      N - This command is for creating a new tree and it will 
          delete the old tree before creating a new tree
      D - This command is for deleting the current tree
      P - This command is for printing the items from quad or from the tree
      I - This command is for inserting the new elements into the tree
          After this command it will ask for the title, description of the tree
          and then user can enter LL and UR addresses for tree
      R - This command is for removing elements from the tree or from the quad
      F - This command is for finding the elements in the tree or in the quad
