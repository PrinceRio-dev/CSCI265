* In the Help menu not clear message after V command, "(prompts/messages)"
  this text string confuses the user

* when I am entering "hello" it will show me the help meanu first and it will show
  four error message which says invalid command but they should be in the new line but they are not

* "Next provide the address of the item's lower left cornerEnter the quaternary address or * for global"
  "Next provide the address of the item's upper right cornerEnter the quaternary address or * for global"
  The given message should have the separate line as per the spec but in out put it is not showing the separate line

* when you enter the invalid address in the verbose mode it will show the warning but after that it will
  not show you the correct message:
  "WARNING: rrrr is not a valid address"
  "(either just *, or 1-10 digits 0-3)" typo here we don't need (1-10) beacuse if you will enter anything
  between 1-10 will give an error message, the valid digits are (0-3)

* when we are printing the single quadrant in the verbose mode it is showing the message like this:
  "Printing quad from "2"" -> this is is not in our requirements so we can remove this string
  "::(2:2200000000,2333333333)" -> after the above message it is printing what we want

* when we are finding the items in the tree when we found the match with title it gives the output as described:
  "Found: p::p(:0000000000,3333333333)" I think that we don't need the "found" word beacuse it is not
  matching with the requirements format. Might me its a wording mistake
