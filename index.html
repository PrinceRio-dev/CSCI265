<h3>265 Lab 4 exercises</h3>
See the <a href="../index.html"> project page</a> for submission deadlines and
late penalties.
<p>
It is assumed you are keeping up to date with the lecture and lab slides and videos.
<p>
This lab focuses on the use of debuggers and profilers, and the writing of bug reports
(as applied to our course project).
<p>
In lab 4, you'll be:
<ol>
<li> pulling recent changes from the instructor's project repository and merging them
     with your own local repo,
<li> fixing two bugs from your lab 3 functional defect list,
<li> conducting an exercise with the gdb debugger and the project source code,
<li> conducting an exercise use valgrind as a memory checker and fixing another bug
     in the project source code,
<li> conducting an exercise with the gprof profiler and the project source code,
<li> pushing your updated repository.
</ol>
<p> Note thate both the debugger and profiler exercises are pretty mechanical here -
the objective is to ensure you've seen/used the key features of each.  I strongly
recommend you try to understand what the debugger/profiler is doing at each step,
such tools can be invaluable down the road.

<p><hr><p><b>Lab instructions</b><p>

<p><hr><p><b>1. pull and merge the instructor's project changes</b>
<br> Make sure you are in your csci265 project repository, your instructor remote
is set up correctly, and then pull the instructor's project changes and merge
them with your project repository.  (If in doubt, this follows the same basic steps as
the start of lab 2.)
<p>
This time, you'll find that the instructor.* files have been eliminated,
and all the remaining .cpp files have been supplied, and the demo.cpp has
been tweaked a bit.
<p>
You'll also find a file named gentest.sh, used to generate (somewhat) random
test files for the demo, and a few additional pre-generated test cases (in tests/quiet).
<p>
<p> When the merge conflicts (if any) are resolved, do an add and commit for the repo.

<p><hr><p><b>2. Fix two functional bugs</b>
<br>  For this part, you are to choose two significant bugs from
your lab 3 functional defect list, analyze the problem and fix them.
<p>
Be sure your fixes adhere to project standards. Be particularly careful to update any
existing comments to match the revised code, use completely separate adds/commits
for the two bug fixes (don't intermingle changes for both fixes in a single commit,
and don't intermingle changes from other parts of lab4 into either of your bug fix
commits), and be sure your commit messages for the two fixes clearly identify which
defects (from your FunctionalDefect.txt) are being fixed.

<p><hr><p><b>3. complete the following debugging exercise </b>
<br> First, we need to recompile with the -g option for gdb to work.
In the command below I'm assuming your makefile has a Warnings variable
initialized to -Wall -Wextra, so we're overriding that from the command line.
<br><tt>make clean</tt>
<br><tt>make Warnings="-g -Wall -Wextra"</tt>
<br> (Make sure it compiled ok before continuing.)
<p> We're going to use the script command below to record our debugging session.
It will record everything you type and everything onscreen while it runs, and
tends to import a lot of garbage if you open an editor or pager in the window 
while it's running, so if you need to open another
tool please do so in a different window.  Note that it doesn't stop recording until
we run the quit command at the end.
<p> Please perform the following steps in sequence, and be sure you understand
what's happening at each point.  (The upcoming quizzes/exam will undoubtedly
include questions on understanding gdb commands and output.)
<ol>
   <p><li> First, let's start the script recording (putting the record in gdb.txt)
           and then start gdb
   <br><tt> script -f gdb.txt </tt>
   <br><tt> gdb gprof </tt>
   <p><li> Now we'll set a couple of breakpoints, one by line number and one by function name,
     so we can examine what the program status is when it reaches those points
   <p> First, set a break point on entry to the printTree method:
   <br><tt> break src/ItemTree.cpp:ItemTree::printTree </tt>
   <p>Next, look in your ItemTree.cpp file and find the switch statement
      inside the insert method.  Look at the line number for the
      <tt>switch (quad .......</tt>, and set a break point for that line, e.g.
      if the switch is on line 62 then use:
   <br><tt> break src/ItemTree.cpp:62 </tt>
   <p><li> Let's start the program running, when prompted enter N to create a new tree,
      and then on the next prompt enter I (for insert), your username (e.g. jdoe) as the title,
      the current time (e.g. 12:23) as the description, and use 1023 and 10311 as the LL and UR
      coordinates when prompted.
      <p>
      Since we set a breakpoint on the switch statement it should stop when we get there.
      <p>
      The variable success should be in scope here, so let's print it and set a watch on it,
      so we're notified if it changes
      <br><tt> print success </tt>
      <br><tt> watch success </tt>
      <p>
      We can get lists of the current breakpoints using
      <br><tt> info breakpoints</tt>
      <p>
      Try the command 'next' to advance one program instruction (treats function calls
      like a single instruction) and 'step' to advance one instruction (but goes
      "inside" functions and continues stepping there)
      <p>
      Use the 'backtrace' command to show the current call heirarchy (which method we're in,
      which one called that, which one called that, etc back to main).
      <p>
      Use the 'cont' command to get the program to resume running normally (continue)
      until it hits the next breakpoint, watchpoint, or prompt.  Watch the program flow
      and the alterations to the 'success' variable and see if they match your expectations.
   <p><li> Finally, let's exit the debugger and then exit the script recording
   <br><tt> quit </tt>
   <br><tt> exit </tt>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to have an add/commit explicitly for your gdb.txt file.

<p><hr><p><b>4. complete the following debugging exercise and fix the issue</b>
<br> Now we'll use valgrind as a memory checker for the demo program.
<p> Note that valgrind also requires us to compile using -g (if you're proceeding directly from
part 3 of the lab to part 4 then you've just done that anyway).
<p> To run valgrind with memory checking on, use the following
<br><tt> valgrind -v --leak-check=full bin/demo</tt>
<br> In the demo program, create a new tree, insert a node, then quit.
<br> In the output portions produced by valgrind, you'll  notice it mentions
some bytes of memory were "definitely lost".  This indicates a memory leak in the code,
some memory was allocated using new but not freed using delete.
<br> Run the program through valgrind again, but this time insert two items before quitting.
<br> You should see that twice as many bytes were "definitely lost".  If you insert
three items you'll see three times as many bytes lost, etc.
<br> This seems to suggest items (or some portion of them) aren't actually being deleted.
<p> Your task: find and fix the memory leak.  (It's not a complex one, and I'd recommend
starting in ItemTree::destroy, since that's where it handles deletion of tree nodes 
and their contents.)

<p><hr><p><b>5. complete the following profiling exercise </b>
<br> To use the gprof profiler,  we need to recompile with a different set
of options, shown below (again with the Warnings variable assumption).
<br><tt>make clean</tt>
<br><tt>make Warnings="-pg -no-pie -fno-builtin"</tt>
<br> (Make sure it compiled ok before continuing.)
<p> Please perform the following steps in sequence, and be sure you understand
what's happening at each point.
<ol>
   <p><li> First, let's use the gentest.sh to generate a mid-sized test case for
           the demo program.  This assumes you still have the tests/quiet directory
           for test cases, otherwise you'll need to take a look in gentest.sh and
           tweak the testDir variable.
           <br><tt>gentest.sh 1000</tt>
           <p>
           You can double-check the demo works on the created file using
           <br><tt>bin/demo < tests/quiet/genFile.1000</tt>
   <p><li> This will have created a file named gmon.out, containing profiling data.
           We'll use gprof to analyze the data, but first we'll pipe it through grep
           to filter out a lot of info about underlying libraries
           <br><tt>gprof bin/demo | grep -v std | grep -v static | grep -v cxx > results.1000</tt>
           <p>
           Note we dumped the analysis results into file results.1000, so we can examine the
           results at our leisure.
   <p><li> Try the same sequence with a 5000 instead of 1000, and browse through the
           gprof results.  (Note: the gentest.sh took several minutes to run when I tried
           this.)
           <p>
           Review the gprof lecture notes/video, to be sure you understand the meaning of the
           table of results (a table like this will certainly crop up in upcoming
           quiz/exam questions).
</ol>
<p>Be sure to have adds/commits explicitly for your results.1000 and .5000
   files, as well as your tests/quiet/genFile.1000 and .5000.

<p><hr><p><b>5. push your work back to the git server</b>
<br>(... first make sure you did your git add and git commit for all the steps above)
<br><tt> git push origin --all</tt>
