BUG REPORT :

When I was working on my lab3 I found some functional defects in it and I have 
choosed my two best functional defects from their and I am writing a report on 
those bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. BUG1 : Greater LL address than UR address while insertion

OS : I was on my Windows 10 machine and I was connted to the VIU server via using
     Software named BitVise, and I was working on Linux machine

Summary :
   Bad : "Cancelling the output which is given by system not by the user"

Description :
   Overview : The bug I have found, I think it is bad for our system beacuse 
              doesn't meet the user requirements. while insertion of the LL address and
              UR address, requirement says that if user enters grater LL address than UR 
              address then it should identify the smallest region whose LL and UR addresses that
              encompass both points and uses the region's LL and UR instead of the user supplied 
              coordinates, but in reality it is not doing what it supposes to do.
   
   Steps to Reproduce :
               1. run the demo program
               2. enter N command
               3. enter I command
               4. give any title you want to give
               5. write any description you want to write
               6. Now please enter greater value for LL address (ex.33333)
               7. Now Please enter lower value than LL for the UR address (ex.00000)
               8. enter P command
               9. enter T command
               10.enter * sign
               11.you will find the bug

   Actual Result :
               It will give you the buggy output. If you follwed the above 
               step carefully then you will get output like this :

               Printing tree from ""
               Start of quadrant
               bug::bug(:3333300000,0000033333)
               end of tree

   Expected Result :
               Printing tree from ""
               Start of quadrant
               bug::bug(:0000000000,3333333333)
               end of tree

   Build Date & Platform :
               Distributor ID: Debian
               Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 9.13 (stretch)
               Release:        9.13
               Codename:       stretch

   More Information :
               It is easy to fix this bug in a short time

2. BUG2 : Showing the error message in non-verbose mode

   OS : I was on my Windows 10 machine and I was connted to the VIU server via using
        Software named BitVise, and I was working on Linux machine

   Summary :
      Good : "Prompting the error message while in non-verbose mode"

   Description :
      Overview : The bug I have found from the demo program, I think so it is good bug and 
                 I can say that it is minor bug. When we are printing and finding the elements 
                 in the tree via non-verbose mode, it asks user to enter his or her choice for single quadrant or for
                 entire tree. User can enter (QqTt) for what they want but if user enters any other characters or string
                 it will display the error message but we are in non-verbose mode and according to the specification
                 it shouldn't display the error message. In addition, it should show user empty string to enter the command again.
                 This thing is happing in finding and printing function. But here I am giving the example of printing function
                
   Steps to Reproduce :
               1. run the demo program ./demo
               2. enter V command
               3. enter N command
               4. enter I command
               5. give any title you want to give
               6. write any single line description you want to write
               7. Now please enter LL address (ex.000000) *you can enter anything that you want
               8. Now Please enter UR address (ex.333333)
               9. enter P command
               10.enter any command other than (QqTt)
               11.you will find the error message that is the bug

   Actual Result :
               It will give you the buggy output. If you follwed the above 
               step carefully then you will get output like this :

               Error: neither quadrant nor tree was selected, please try again

   Expected Result :
               We are expecting empty string that mean user can enter command again or we can say blank line
               
   Build Date & Platform :
               Distributor ID: Debian
               Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 9.13 (stretch)
               Release:        9.13
               Codename:       stretch

   More Information :
               I think so we can esily fix this minor bug
