* Warnings and error messages are not directed to the standard error stream, everything
  is directed to the standard output stream

* when I am entering the "nice job", it will create 'n' new tree and 'i' as an insert command but "ce job"
  should be the title of the tree but it is asking me to enter the title of the tree and so that is
  the reason it is not behaving according to specification

* spec says that delete command should not produce the output but when you already deleted the tree and 
  entering the command again and again it is showing error message and it should go to the standard error stream

* when I enter address string which is greater than permitted address length then it should take first M
  characters while inserting the item, but in reality it is taking the same address length which is entered by the user

* when you enter the greater LL address than UR address then it is Not identifying
  the smallest region points and it is still taking the cordiantes which is 
  supplied by the user

* when you enter the valid data while insertion in the quiet mode it shows the message like "Item inserted in quadrant"
  but as per spec it should simply proceeds to the routine command prompt

* when you enter invalid choice other than qQtT in the quiet mode then it will show you the message like
  "Error: neither quadrant nor tree was selected, please try again" but in the spec it says it should 
  not give any message to user
